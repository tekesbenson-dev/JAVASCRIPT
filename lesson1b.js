// in JS we need to have am initializer before declaring varaibles. In ES6 we have two main types of initializers i.e:

// let : it declares values which can be changed later on. 
  let weight = 10.5

  console.log(weight)

  // const : it is used to declare varuables which contain values that or not intended to be changed the entire program

  const pi = 3.142
  console.log(" the pi is:", pi)
